# Overview
The plugins in this repo are exclusively for Red Bot. Please read over the installation instructions and documentation for more information on how to use these cogs.

# Installation
First make sure you have [Red Bot V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/develop) installed.

Next add my repo using the following command:  

`[p]repo add creamycogs https://github.com/njhargis/creamy-cogs V3`    

> [p] will be your prefix.

Then, you will have to download each cog individually. For example, if you want to download the League of Legends cog, you would enter the following command:

`>cog install creamycogs leaguecog`

Make sure that you use the `[p]cog update` command to periodically update my cogs. This will ensure that you are getting the latest bug fixes and features. You may also update a specific cog by typing `[p]cog update leaguecog`.

If you have an issue with one of my plugins, then create an issue. **DO NOT DM ME ON DISCORD.** I get a ton of DMs and I can't manage to answer all of them. Posting an issue will be the fastest way for me to resolve your problem.
